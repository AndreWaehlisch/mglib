See documentation of the API for the routines in this library in::

  api-userdocs/index.html

Most of the routines in this library are `.pro` code that can easily be added
to `IDL_PATH`, but there are some routines that are written in C that should be
compiled. See `INSTALL.rst` for instructions on how to build the C DLM's in
this library.
