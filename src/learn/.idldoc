Machine learning routines, classes, and example datasets.

The classes are broken into two main categories:

1. estimators (regressors and classifiers): These classes have a `fit` method that is called first, and then a `predict` method called afterwards. Regressors predict a continuous quantity, while classifiers predict categories.

2. transformer: These classes have a `fit` method that is called first and then a `transform` method called afterwards (or use the convenicene `fit_transform` method) which transforms data to a suitable form for applying an estimator.
