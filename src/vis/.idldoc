Library of routines to facilitate creating better visualizations controlled 
from IDL, though not using IDL exclusively. Some routines use external applications such as ImageMagick and POV-Ray.

Both direct graphics and object graphics systems are addressed; many routines
calculate graphics system independent data like a set of vertices and 
connectivity list that can be visualized in either graphics system.
