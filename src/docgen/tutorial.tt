`mg_docgen` is a utility to produce text output that combines static written
text and the output from IDL. This is perfect for writing tutorials on how to
use an IDL routine, documenting your scientific process, etc.

Using `mg_docgen` is easy. You will need to create a `docgen.ini` in a directory
indicating the files that `mg_docgen` should process. For example, this tutorial
is produced with the following `docgen.ini` file:

    [% INSERT docgen.ini %]

This contains an `IDL` section, which specifies the template input files (and
the output filename) that should be run through IDL. Other sections can be
present and accessed in the templates via the `MGffOptions` object `config`:

    [% INSERT example.tt %]

This should produce:

    [% INSERT example.rst %]

You can capture the output from running code with the `CAPTURE` template
directive. For example, do:

    IDL> result = mg_capture('print, findgen(10)')
    IDL> print, result

This yields:

    [% mg_capture('print, findgen(10)') %]
