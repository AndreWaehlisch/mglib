`mg_docgen` is a utility to produce text output that combines static written
text and the output from IDL. This is perfect for writing tutorials on how to
use an IDL routine, documenting your scientific process, etc.

Using `mg_docgen` is easy. You will need to create a `docgen.ini` in a directory
indicating the files that `mg_docgen` should process. For example, this tutorial
is produced with the following `docgen.ini` file:

    [% INSERT docgen.ini %]
