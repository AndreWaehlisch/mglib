The `dist_tools` package is a collection of routines useful in several areas when creating applications for distribution to others.

The main directory `./` provides basic routines that are extremely valuable whenever distributing an application like the `MG_SRC_ROOT` routine, `MGffPrefs` class, or `MG_IDLVERSION` routine. The `MG_LOG` routine and `MGffLogger` class provide a mechanism for logging in applications.


Installation
------------

To get the current version of the `dist_tools`, use a Subversion client to grab the current trunk of the repository. For example, to use the command line `svn` command from a system prompt::

   $ svn co http://svn.idldev.com/dist_tools/trunk dist_tools
