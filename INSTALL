To install the cmdline_tools package::

  1. Place the src/ directory in the `!path` and `!dlm_path` with your 
     preferred method, i.e., on UNIX platforms the `IDL_PATH` and 
     `IDL_DLM_PATH` environment variables can be appended to.
     
  2. Build the cmdline_tools DLM. On UNIX platforms, you should be able to
     simply use the Makefile in the top-level directory, i.e., type::
     
        $ make
        
     On Windows systems, use `mg_build_cmdline_tools_docs.pro` from within IDL 
     to build::
     
        IDL> mg_build_cmdline_tools_docs
        
     A correctly configured `!make_dll` system variable (using a compiler that 
     is installed on the system) and the cmdline_tools package are required to
     build.
     
  3. To test the cmdline_tools package, the mgunit package is required. On 
     UNIX platforms, use the `unit` makefile target::
     
        $ make unit
        
     On Windows systems, use mgunit directly::
     
        IDL> mgunit, 'cmdline_tools_uts'
        
     from the `unittests` directory.
